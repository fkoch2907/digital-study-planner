# Digital Study Planner
Advanced Practical Python Development Project 2025

We will create a digital planner to help students get organised with their classes, projects and homework. It will have an interface, you will be able to import your schedule or create it using the interface, there will be a space to add To-Dos and if the time allows it, additional features will be added (e.g. "Meme of the day" etc.).

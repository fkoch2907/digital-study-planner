"""
This file stores the definition of the calendar class and its methodes.

We want to create a calendar-like object (final product) in this project.

This calendar should contain the following methodes (functionalities):

- It automatically shows up the current date/time and the events on the day
- It can create a new, empty calendar
- It can add new events with an event name, start/end time, repeat period, and its event type
- It can view events that occur in a month/week/day
- It includes a to-do list. A list of tasks with/without any specific time settings, and can be viewed and edited at
any time
    - (for the end) with overlay decoration
    - Can also automatically include events that occur within a time range (user can set it), such as including events
    within 3 days
- task reminder/notification system for hand-in, deadlines
    - with a day counter

first version: interactive via the terminal window
